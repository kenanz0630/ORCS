# Optimal-Ratio Control Scheme (ORCS)
  This package includes Matlab codes based on the paper
  [Zhang, K., Nie, Y. M. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X17303728) <br>
  
  The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimizatiom problem: <br>
  * The upper level problem determines the optimal control ratio of each OD pair; <br>
  * The lower level problem solves the mixed equilibrium of traffic assignment problem with multiple user classes (SO and UE users). <br>
  
  A numerical example of [Sioux Falls network](https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks) is provided.
